  abstract  = {A common swarm task is to disperse evenly through an environment from an initial tightly packed formation. Due to communication and sensing limitations, it is often necessary to execute this task with little or no communication between swarm members. Prior approaches based on repulsive forces or uniform random walks motion, unfortunately, converge slowly or pass through bad transient states before converging. A simple integrate-and-fire mechanism, however, can generate modified Levy flights, thereby producing a near-optimal rapid and monotonic dispersion with no communication. This mechanism also produces rapid mixing of swarms and is a plausibly evolvable generator for the Levy flight behaviors observed in biological organisms.},

Previously, however, function evaluation has always been defined in terms of a complete in lining of expressions during compilation. This simplified the definition of programs, at the cost of limiting expressiveness and duplicating code in compiled binaries. In this paper, we address these shortcomings, producing a model of in-place function evaluation and analysis of its implications for Proto. We have extended the MIT Proto compiler and Proto Kernel virtual machine to implement this model, and empirically verified the reduction of compiled binary size.},

The sensing needs of many other potential information consumers might thus be served by sharing such sensors, allowing other information consumers to opportunistically task them during their otherwise unscheduled time. Toward this end, we have developed Mission-Driven Tasking of Information Producers (MTIP), a prototype system for opportunistic sharing of airborne sensors. This paper describes its implementation as an agent-based task allocation system on top of the Marti Quality of Service (QoS)-managed publish-subscribe information management system, and presents simulations of a disaster response scenario demonstrating how MTIP can increase the number of sensor tasks served as well as reducing the number of UAVs required to serve a given set of sensor tasks.},

Opportunistic sensor sharing, e.g., via the Mission-Driven Tasking of Information Producers (MTIP) can greatly improve sensor utilization, both decreasing the number of platforms needed to achieve a goal and increasing sensor efficacy. Dynamically changing environments, however, are likely to rapidly render any initial plan obsolete.

  abstract  = {A key problem when coordinating the behaviour of devices in situated networks (e.g., pervasive computing, smart cities, Internet of Things, wireless sensor networks) is adaptation to changes impacting network topology, density, and heterogeneity. Computational goals for such systems are often expressed in terms of geometric properties of the continuous environment in which the devices are situated, and the results of resilient computations should depend primarily on that continuous environment, rather than the particulars of how devices happen to be distributed through it. In this paper, we identify a new property of distributed algorithms, eventual consistency, which guarantees that computation selfstabilizes to a final state that approximates a predictable limit as the density and speed of devices increases. We then identify a large class of programs that are eventually consistent, building on prior results on the field calculus computational model to identify a class of self-stabilizing programs. Finally, we confirm through simulation of pervasive network scenarios that eventually consistent programs from this class can provide resilient behavior where programs that are only self-stabilizing fail badly.},

Here we present an adaptive algorithm for addressing a common management problem in enterprise service networks: safely and rapidly recovering from the failure of one or more services. Due to poorly documented and shifting dependencies, a typical industry practice for this situation is to bring the entire system down, then to restart services one at a time in a predefined order. We improve on this practice with the Dependency-Directed Recovery (DDR) algorithm, which senses dependencies by observing network interactions and recovers near-optimally from failures following a distributed graph algorithm. Our Java-based implementation of this system is suitable for deployment with a wide variety of networked enterprise services, and we validate its correct operation and advantage over fixed-order restart with emulation experiments on networks of up to 20 services.},

As a first step to understanding, how they behave in interconnections involving other building blocks, it is important to develop a Lyapunov framework to demonstrate their robust stability. This paper addresses this shortcoming by providing the first Lyapunov-based analysis of an adaptive Bellman-Ford algorithm, by formulating a simple Lyapunov function. This analysis proves global uniform asymptotic stability of such algorithms, a property which the classical Bellman-Ford algorithm lacks, thus demonstrating a measure of robustness to structural perturbations, empirically observed by us in a previous work.},

  abstract  = {Recent works in the context of large-scale adaptive systems, such as those based on opportunistic IoT-based applications, promote aggregate programming, a development approach for distributed systems in which the collectivity of devices is directly targeted, instead of individual ones. This makes the resulting behaviour highly insensitive to network size, density, and topology, and as such, intrinsically robust to failures and changes to working conditions (e.g., location of computational load, communication technology, and computational infrastructure). Most specifically, we argue that aggregate programming is particularly suitable for building models and simulations of complex large-scale reactive MASs. Accordingly, in this paper we describe SCAFI (Scala Fields), a Scala-based API and DSL for aggregate programming, and its integration with the ALCHEMIST simulator, and usage scenarios in the context of smart mobility.},

  abstract  = {Aggregate computing is an emerging approach to the engineering of complex coordination for distributed systems, based on viewing system interactions in terms of information propagating through collectives of devices, rather than in terms of individual devices and their interaction with their peers and environment. The foundation of this approach is the distillation of a number of prior approaches, both formal and pragmatic, proposed under the umbrella of field-based coordination, and culminating into the field calculus, a functional programming model for the specification and composition of collective behaviours with equivalent local and aggregate semantics. This foundation has been elaborated into a layered approach to engineering coordination of complex distributed systems, building up to pragmatic applications through intermediate layers encompassing reusable libraries of provably resilient program components. In this survey, we trace the development and antecedents of field calculus, review the current state of aggregate computing theory and practice, and discuss a roadmap of current research directions that we believe can significantly impact the agenda of coordination models and languages.},

  abstract  = {In spatial computing, there is a fundamental tension between discrete and continuous models of computation: computational devices are generally discrete, yet it is often useful to program them in terms of the continuous environment through which they are embedded. Aggregate programming models for spatial computers have attempted to resolve this tension in a variety of different ways, generating a profusion of approaches that are difficult to compare or combine. Recently, however, two minimal models have been proposed: continuous space-time universality and a discrete field calculus. This paper unifies these two models by proving that field calculus is space-time universal, and thus provides the first formal connection between continuous and discrete approaches to spatial computing.},

On the one hand, aggregate programming, and especially computational fields-based programming, is a promising abstraction for coordinating the activities of multiple situated devices. On the other hand, augmented reality is emerging as new means of interaction with both software and physical entities. We note that both computational fields and augmented reality are tightly bound to the physical world, and that they both enrich it, with collective computation and augmented information respectively. This work presents an initial analysis of possible future research directions that involve these techniques, discussing some possible ways of integrating them.},
